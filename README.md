# SudokkuCli

A CLI program for logging in to Sudokku git server.

## Installation

    $ gem install sudokku_cli

## Usage

Use `sudokku login` to log in to the Sudokku git server. This will try to connect to the git server using credentials saved
in your .netrc file. If the credentials are not found, or are expired, you will be given a url to visit where you can log in.
After successfully logging in, the program will save the newly generated credentials to your .netrc file.
